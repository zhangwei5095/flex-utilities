Apache FlexJS
=============

    Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that has the goal of allowing 
    applications developed in MXML and ActionScript to not only run in the 
    Flash/AIR runtimes, but also to run natively in the browser without Flash, 
    on mobile devices as a PhoneGap/Cordova application, and in embedded JS 
    environments such as Chromium Embedded Framework.  FlexJS has the potential 
    to allow your MXML and ActionScript code to run in even more places than 
    Flash currently does.

Installation
==================================

    Install the Apache FlexJS NPM Module globally

    npm install flexjs -g
	(There are a couple of prompts you need to answer before installation starts)
	
Usage
==================================	

    After global installation, the following compiler tools will be available for you 
	to use: mxmlc, asjsc and asjscompc
	
	Usage: 
	mxmlc <path to main .mxml file>
	asjsc <path to main .as file>
	asjscompc <path to main .as file>
	
Examples
==================================	

    There are several examples that ship with the FlexJS npm module. They are located in:
    Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\flexjs\examples\
	Mac:	/usr/local/lib/node_modules/flexjs/examples/ 
	
	You can compile them with FlexJS like this:
	
	MXMLC (Targets apps built for the FlexJS SDK, which creats a swf file as well as 
	HTML5/JavaScript output)
	
	Windows: mxmlc C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\flexjs\examples\flexjs\ChartExample\src\ChartExample.mxml
	Mac: mxmlc /usr/local/lib/node_modules/flexjs/examples/flexjs/ChartExample/src/ChartExample.mxml
	
	ASJSC (Write ActionScript3 targeting HTML5/SVG DOM without requiring JavaScript):
	
	Windows: asjsc C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\flexjs\examples\native\USStatesMap\src\USStatesMap.as
	Mac: asjsc /usr/local/lib/node_modules/flexjs/examples/native/USStatesMap/src/USStatesMap.as
	
    You may need to copy the examples to a writeable folder because the compilation
    will generate an output folder in the example folders.
